            <h3>History</h3>
            <p> the city's origins can be traced back to over 2,000 years ago, its true significance came about in the early years of the Western Zhou Dynasty (11th century BC-771 BC). During this time the emperor gave the feudal lords under his rule plots of land. One of these plots of land (or feod), called 'Ji City', was the capital of the kingdom 'Ji' at that time. This city was the earliest in Beijing history. By the time of the Eastern Zhou Period (476 BC-221 BC), the kingdom Ji no longer existed, being replaced by the kingdom 'Yan'. However, Ji was still the capital city at that time.

            From the time the Emperor Qin Shi Huang unified China in the year 221 BC, Beijing became a strategic place and local kaiserdom center in the northern part of China. From the year 581 to 618 (Sui Dynasty), Beijing was called 'Zhuo' and had a population of 130,000 people. From 618 to 907 (Tang Dynasty), Beijing was called 'You'. During these two dynasties, it was not only a strategic military place but also the major trade center.

            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Taoism…religion in Beijing is as diverse as its architecture; temples, churches, mosques and synagogues are all present. 

            <b>Islam</b>
            Beijing’s over 40 mosques are testament to the substantial population of Muslims in China. Having arrived through trade links with Persia during the Tang and Song dynasties (618-1279), Islam became a fully accepted religion during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Today, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is still home to the greatest number of Muslims in China. The Islamic People worship at theDongsi Mosque 东四清真寺
            Christianity

Records have Christianity first setting foot on Chinese soil in the 7th century, but it was later, with the arrival of the Jesuits in the 1670s and of the first protestant missionaries in 1807, that it really had an impact. Christianity was made legal by the Qing government following the Opium War (1840-42).

            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Beijing has been the magnificent centre of traditional Chinese culture and learning since the Ming dynasty. Emperors and courtiers patronized the arts, especially painting and calligraphy. Precious objects from other parts of the empire and from foreign countries poured into the capital. This role of cultural centre was continued during the Qing dynasty, although the century of political and social upheaval that began in the mid-19th century led to an overall cultural decline in both Beijing and the whole of China. In the late 1940s the Nationalists shipped a huge quantity of art treasures to Taiwan before their defeat by the communists. On the mainland, subsequently, many family heirlooms were purchased by the state for low prices and were then sold for export or used to enhance the country’s museum holdings.

            <h3>Historic Sites</h3>
            <p>Beijing, with a history of more than 3,000 years, is the ancient capital of the Six Dynasties, including that of Ming and Qing Dynasties (1368 – 1911), the closest dynasties to the present. Hence, there are a large number of historical sites in Beijing, from royal palaces to folk houses, imperial gardens to princes’ mansions, ancient colleges to religious temples… Here are top 10 Beijing historical sites you should not miss. 
            <br><b>1.The Forbidden City</b>As the most famous historical site in Beijing, the Forbidden City with a history of 600 years was the royal palace of 24 emperors of Ming and Qing Dynasties. The complete and large-scale wooden architectural complex and numerous cultural relics have always been a must for foreign visitors to Beijing. These magnificent buildings are divided into two parts - the outer court and the inner court. The outer court was the place where the emperors dealt with state affairs while the emperors and his families lived in the inner court. Millions of cultural relics in the Forbidden City are displayed either in their original palace or gathered together for better preservation.

            <h3>Economy</h3>
            <p>As the capital city of the most populous nation on Earth, Beijing plays an important role in China’s economy. With a consumer base of more than 20 million, Beijing has become more and more important for foreign companies in many industries. For anyone looking to the Middle Kingdom as a business opportunity, it is essential to understand the workings of Beijing’s economy.

            Measured by purchasing power parity (PPP) Beijing’s GDP was worth just over $1 trillion in 2019, about the same as that of the Philippines. Compared to the Philippines’ 100 million citizens however, Beijing’s population of 21 million enjoys a larger share of this economic productivity, with GDP per capita (PPP) of roughly $46,000. By this measure, Beijing’s economy is the most highly developed of administrative divisions in China, outranking even Shanghai. What’s more, this figure has been growing at roughly the same pace as the national economy for the past few years, which is roughly 6%. With such high levels of economic productivity, it is impressive that Beijing’s economy can still grow at this rate.

            <h3>Local People</h3>
            <p>Beijing, the capital of China, beautifully blends ancient and modern Chinese cultures. A cosmopolitan metropolis combining both the history and modernity is what you can expect to experience on Beijing tours. Beijing local's live an interesting life that combines these two elements. They go about their lives while being surrounded by some of the most spectacular historical places in the world.

            Early in the morning, Beijing's elderly can be seen in mass heading to Beijing's parks, squares, and the historical Temple of Heaven to do their morning exercises. They can be seen in groups practicing tai chi, performing martial arts, doing Yangge (a local dance), and playing with Beijing's tops. This is a site that can be seen throughout China, but with some unique differences.
            
            Beijing's Hutongs are a twisting labyrinth of alleyways and courtyard homes. People in Beijing traditionally lived in Hutongs. The Hutong communities are very special. Since most people have lived in the Hutongs for generations, they all know each other and each Hutong is like a mini community inside the bustling metropolis. Many visitors choose to hire a pedicab or rent a bicycle to visit Beijing's Hutongs. Riding through the ancient alleyways and peeking at ancient courtyard homes takes visitors back to a more slow paced life. In China it is typical for grandparents to take care of their grandchildren and grandfathers can be seen walking their grandchildren down the alley to a little shop to buy some sweets and get a bit of gossip.
            
            Another favorite pastime of Beijingers is Peking (Beijing) Opera. Peking Opera has a history of over 200 years. It is extremely popular, especially amongst the elderly who enjoy watching it in the evenings. Peking Opera has become more popular with visitors over the recent years. With its colorful costumes dazzling face paints and fantastic martial arts, it is a little wonder that tourists should not miss on their tour in Beijing.
            
            While the local elderly enjoy Peking Opera, the younger generation enjoy going to bars, night clubs, and KTV. Beijing is famous for its jumping nightlife. The mot hopping night spots can be found on San Li Tun Bar Street, Wangfujing and Xidan. Many of Beijing's fashionable young ladies like to spend the evenings shopping in Beijing's many boutiques on Wangfujing Street and Xidan shopping center. The middle aged can be seen in the evening doing western dances in the parks.
